# essentials

## `fd`
[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a stupid fast replacement for `find`

## `ripgrep`
[rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) replaces grep 90% of the time for me

## `tig`
[tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig) is a lightweight ncurses-style cli git viewer. Best way to view the git log and commit info, imho.

## `gron`
[gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron) makes json easily parsable with grep (or `rg`!)
